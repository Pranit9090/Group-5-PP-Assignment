Name:Pratik Naik roll no:-IT2137 This file is for Constructor in C++. Constructor in C++ is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.

PP Assignment Name:- Dhanashri Bagul Roll no:- IT2150 This file contain code related to Destructor.A destructor in programming is a special method that is automatically called when an object is no longer needed or goes out of scope.

Name- Shravani Anil Yadav, Roll No.- IT2144 This file is dedicated to the concept of Friend Function in C++ programming.Encapsulation is a crucial concept that promotes data protection and controlled access to a class's internal members. This ensures that sensitive data remains secure and that modifications are made only through authorized channels. However, encapsulation can sometimes pose challenges when external functions need to access a class's private or protected members. To address this issue, C++ introduces the concept of friend functions.

Name: Pranjali Ashok Awchar Roll_no.: IT2149 This file is dedicated to the concept of the Static Data Member and Static Function used in the praogramming. A static data member in a class is a variable that belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. It's shared among all instances, and there's only one copy of it in memory. A static function in a class is a method that belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. It can be called on the class itself, not requiring an instance, and it cannot access non-static members directly.

Name- Piyush Rajkumar Wattamwar Roll no.- IT2143 This file is dedicated to concept of inheritance It is one of feature in c++ that allows one class to inherit features or functionality of another class which helps in better code organisation and reuse code.

Name:Maheshwary Deepak Narkhede Roll_No:-IT2138 This file is dedicated to the concept of polymorphism in programming. Polymorphism, a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming, allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. This concept enhances code flexibility and reusability.

Name:Pranit Youraj kadam class:It S.y (A) Roll no:IT2132 This repository contains C++ code that demonstrates the concept of operator overloading. Operator overloading is a powerful feature in C++ that allows you to define custom behaviors for operators when used with user-defined types. This enhances the readability and flexibility of your code.
